# KandySMSPython

Interested in getting the Kandy SMS API working in Python? 

The file <a href="https://github.com/wndsrfr21/KandySMSPython/blob/master/kandy_sms_demo.py"> KandySMSPython.py</A> file will help get you started with minimal effort. 

Just make sure the following three items are taken care of:
1) Get Your API Keys - Create an account on http://developer.kandy.io/ and copy out the "domain api key" and "domain api secret" 
2) Update the destination phone number - Make sure the format of the number is +1xxxYYYzzzz
3) Make sure Python Requests is installed - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

Once you have the above items taken care of, you can run this code on either a desktop/laptop or Raspberry Pi!
