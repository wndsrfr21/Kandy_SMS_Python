# KandySMSPython - Python helper library for Kandy SMS API

Interested in getting the Kandy SMS API working in Python? 

The file <a href="https://github.com/wndsrfr21/KandySMSPython/blob/master/kandy_sms_demo.py"> KandySMSPython.py</A> file will help get you started with minimal effort. 

Just make sure the following three items are taken care of and you are off to the races:
1) Get Your API Keys - Lines 5 & 6 - Create an account on http://developer.kandy.io/ and copy out the "domain api key" and "domain api secret" 
2) Update the destination phone number - Line 29 - Make sure the format of the number is +1xxxYYYzzzz
3) Make sure Python Requests is installed - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

Running the KandySMSPython.py File
Step 1 - Open a terminal console (press the command button and the space bar and then type "terminal" within the new popup)
Step 2 - Navigate to the folder containing the file called "KandySMSPython.py"
Step 3 - Type the command "python kandysmspython.py" and hit enter

The system will think for couple of seconds and then the destination number should get a text message!
